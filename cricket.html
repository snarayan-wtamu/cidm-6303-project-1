        <h2>India: The Powerhouse of World Cricket</h2>
        <p>Cricket in India is more than a sport—it's a national obsession. With a massive fan base and an ever-growing
          television and digital viewership, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has become the wealthiest
          and most influential cricket body globally—surpassing even the International Cricket Council (ICC) in terms of
          financial power. The Indian Premier League (IPL), with billion-dollar sponsorships and celebrity ownerships,
          has redefined how the world views franchise cricket. However, this massive popularity also brings challenges,
          such as concerns over illegal betting, match-fixing, and media pressure on players.</p>

        <h2>Iconic Rivalries: Beyond the Boundary</h2>
        <p>Few sporting events match the intensity of an India vs Pakistan cricket match. Rooted in political history
          and cultural passion, these games draw hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide. Similarly, the Ashes series
          between England and Australia dates back to 1882 and remains one of the most storied rivalries in sport. These
          high-stakes contests are more than just about runs and wickets—they’re about national pride, legacy, and the
          heartbeats of fans across generations.</p>

        <h2>USA's Emerging Presence in Cricket</h2>
        <p>Yes, there is a Team USA—and they’re making moves. While cricket isn’t mainstream in America (yet), the U.S.
          has participated in ICC tournaments, including a World Cup appearance in 2004. The team is evolving with a mix
          of American-born players and international talent, many of whom have migrated from cricket-dominant nations.
          With the launch of Major League Cricket (MLC) and ICC World Cup 2024 matches co-hosted in the U.S., the buzz
          around the sport is picking up like never before.</p>

        <h2>Cricket in the USA: From Niche to Notable</h2>
        <p>The United States, long dominated by baseball and football, is now seeing cricket gaining traction—especially
          in communities with roots in South Asia, the Caribbean, and England. Cricket academies are popping up in
          cities like Houston, Atlanta, and San Jose. Streaming platforms now carry live cricket coverage, and American
          investors are backing new leagues. The combination of grassroots interest and international collaboration
          could make cricket a surprising success story in American sports over the next decade.</p>
