        <h3>Aryaman Narayan</h3>
        <p>Aryaman, my elder son, approaches soccer like a strategist. He’s thoughtful on the field, always looking to
          create plays and connect passes. Playing as a midfielder, he values team coordination and has a natural eye
          for reading the game. Watching him grow into a leader — calling plays, encouraging teammates — has been one of
          the highlights of my parenting journey. Whether it’s morning drills or post-game analysis, Aryaman always
          wants to improve. His favorite team? FC Barcelona. His idol? Messi, of course. But to me, he’ll always be the
          quiet MVP of every match.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="images/soccer2.png" alt="Arjun team huddle'" class="soccer-img mb-3">
        <h3>Arjun Narayan</h3>
        <p>If Aryaman is the tactician, Arjun is the spark. Quick-footed, energetic, and fearless, Arjun thrives on
          speed and instinct. He usually plays forward and is the first to charge the goal with a smile that never
          fades. He’s the kind of player who’ll trip, laugh, bounce back up, and still score. His joy is infectious and
          reminds everyone around him that soccer is fun — even when it’s competitive. Arjun loves Manchester City,
          especially Kevin De Bruyne. His dream is to wear the number 17 jersey one day. Mine? To keep cheering him on
          as loud as possible.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Why Soccer Matters to Our Family</h3>
        <p class="text-center mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px;">
          Soccer has become more than just a sport in our household — it's our weekend ritual, our fitness routine, and
          our shared language. Whether we're out practicing corner kicks, reviewing old match footage, or simply
          cheering on our favorite teams, the game brings us together. It's taught my boys sportsmanship, resilience,
          and discipline — values that extend far beyond the pitch. And for me, it’s a joy to be involved not just as a
          parent, but as a participant in their journey, win or lose.
